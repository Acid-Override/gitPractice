  <h2>General Help</h2>
  <p>As web designers and front-end developers, we have the luxury of attending a number of great conferences dedicated
    to our craft. We’re going to make up our own conference, Styles Conference, and build a website for it throughout
    the following lessons. Here we go!</p>

  <h3>Behaviour</h3>
  <p>Let’s open our text editor, create a new file named index.html, and save it to a location we won’t forget. I’m
    going to create a folder on my Desktop named “styles- conference” and save this file there; feel free to do the
    same.</p>

  <h4>Salvation</h4>
  <p>No matter how careful we are when writing our code, we will inevitably make mistakes. Thankfully, when writing HTML
    and CSS we have validators to check our work. The W3C has built both HTML and CSS validators that will scan code for
    mistakes. Validating our code not only helps it render properly across all browsers, but also helps teach us the
    best practices for writing code.</p>
